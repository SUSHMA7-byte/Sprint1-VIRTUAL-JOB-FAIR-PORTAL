In Sprint 1, we built the backend foundation of the Virtual Job Fair Portal using Java and MySQL. Key highlights include:

-> Designed a fully normalized relational database schema.

-> Implemented modular CRUD operations using JDBC.

-> Created object-oriented models for core entities like Candidate, Job, and Company.

-> Integrated multithreading to simulate concurrent job applications.

-> Handled JDBC exceptions and achieved smooth database connectivity.

This sprint enhanced our skills in SQL, JDBC, thread management, and collaborative backend development.
